# Animation-NN
Learned Motion Matching, and more...

Here, I will record and track the progress of the project.
__More information about each item can be found under the TODO list in Projects.__

Tracking Progress:

# Week 1-5: 
Was unable to start due to obligations in Computer Vision Research (and HW in week 5)...

Starting from week 6, I will try to work at least 2 days every-week to make up for lost time.
# Week 6: 
2-day workload this week. 
* Created a Slack Channel + Invited Roi to Channel.
* Setup a Github + Github Projects TODO list (can be found under Projects). 
* Updated TODOs in Github Projects.
* Setup the Environment: Installed Unity, Visual Studio, C#, PyCharm, Conda, CUDA tools, GeForceExperience, Python, and Pytorch.
* Read the official article and the paper (of Learned Motion Matching) fully. Still need additional understanding.
* Took a brief look at suggested link (https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation) AI4Animation. Found out I needed TensorFlow to take a closer look.

# Week 7:
2-day workload this week. (X to be filled later)
* Updated TODOs in Github Projects.
* Setup Tensorflow + Small Ramp up comparing Tensorflow and Pytorch implementation: https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-vs-tensorflow-spotting-the-difference-25c75777377b
* Solved issues with Tensorflow Setup + Pytorch that got messed up. (dependency issues - tf didn't compile)
Problem of TF in greater detail (in case of this happening again):
numpy caused all sorts of problems when introduced in a combined environment with TF. To solve this,
start a new environment, and install Numpy 19.4.2 using:

__conda install -c esgf numpy__

Then, install Tensorflow version that comes with the command:

__conda install -c anaconda tensorflow__
* Installed Unity 2018.3.0f2 version - to match AI4Animation installation.
* Successfully ran one of the demos, yay!
* Explored rest of the demos and played with the run-times.
* Very basic and Initial Familiarization with all runs.
* Talked to Roi and got general direction of what to do in the meantime.

# Week 8:
0-day workload this week. (Got ill :()

# Week 9:
2-day workload this week.
* Read the paper and gained general understanding of the code..
* Reported to Roi.
* Ran various simulations to gain more insight on system's limits.
* Wrote notes on possible improvements.
* (In progress) reading code and comparing it to paper..
