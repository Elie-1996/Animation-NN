# Animation-NN
Learned Motion Matching, and more...

Here, I will record and track the progress of the project.
__More information about each item can be found under the TODO list in Projects.__

Tracking Progress:

# Week 1-5: 
Was unable to start due to obligations in Computer Vision Research (and HW in week 5)...

Starting from week 6, I will try to work at least 2 days every-week to make up for lost time.
# Week 6: 
2-day workload this week. 
* Created a Slack Channel + Invited Roee to Channel.
* Setup a Github + Github Projects TODO list (can be found under Projects). 
* Setup the Environment: Installed Unity, Visual Studio, C#, PyCharm, Conda, CUDA tools, GeForceExperience, Python, and Pytorch.
* Read the official article and the paper (of Learned Motion Matching) fully. Still need additional understanding.
* Took a look at suggested link (https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation) AI4Animation. Found out I need TensorFlow to run it.
